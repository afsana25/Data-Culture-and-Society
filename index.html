        The project's motivation is to show whether the data is legit based on Bookings.edu data of gender with ages ranging from 25 years to 34 years old with  bachelor degrees or higher
         education in US states, US census data for per capita income, worldpopulationreview.com data of poverty rate and the "statistica" education data from 1940 to 2021 based on gender. 
         Most of the time, we believe government data is accurate, but is it true? In this project, we will discuss whether we see the data is biased or whether any power or privilege plays a role. 
         In the back behind any data presentation or visualization, we don't know how data collection has been made. Is it collected ideally or not? Can the data be highly influenced by power
          and position? In this project, we will use these data sources to discuss 
        whether the data are legit and how safe our data is based on some visualizations such as choropleth map,  time series, and bar charts and also discuss about the result of the visualizations.

      <div>
       
        <h6> Data Collection and Manipulation:</h6>
        <p class="viz-large">All the data have been collected from the US census, worldpopulationreview.com, statistica, and Booking article. 
          The per capita has been collected from the US census, and the poverty rate has been collected from worldpopulationreview.com in Excel format. 
          The education data for bachelor's degrees or higher education based on gender has collected from the Bookings article. From the statistica website, 
          the time series data has been collected. The data was cleaned and combined by SQL, and the null values were dropped for further analysis. Other data combinations
           completed in Excel. In GEO-JSON format, the US state geographic
           data has been collected and manually added the indicators such as per capita income, male and female education percentage rate, and poverty rate. </p><br>
  <div>
  
   
      <div>
        <h5> Visulizations:</h5>
  
        <p class="viz-large"> 
          The choropleth map of the United States has been completed in JavaScript using the d3. The geo JSON data file has been used to complete the map. The first visual, the choropleth map 
          is based on the criteria of the poverty group, with the darker green color representing high poverty, the middle green color representing moderate poverty, and the less green color representing 
          lower poverty rates within the US. The map also added with hovering over the Percentage of males and females having a bachelor's degree or higher education (25 years to 34 years). The second visualization
           is a time series to show how the progress rate of education based on gender  from 1940 to 2021(in years).
           The last four bar charts are created in Excel to show the five highest and lowest education attainment (Bachelor's degree or higher) states based on the percentage of gender identities.

      <div>
        <h5> Analyses:</h5>
  
        <p class="viz-large">  
          In the first visualization, It is easily shown that Mississippi and Louisiana have the highest poverty Rate. The data source (worldpopulationreview.com) for Poverty Rate 
          says that it has collected data from US Census but doesn't tell how it has been collected. It provides the poverty rate but doesn't show how the algorithm has performed or 
          what kind of statistics are used to calculate the poverty Rate. The second time series data source(www.statista.com) has also collected from US Census data, and they also 
          didn't discuss how they have been collected the data, Many of us easily believe that the US Census would be accurate, but we don't know how it has been collected, how the 
          algorithm is used, or whether each state has a different calculation of the poverty Rate or any demographic indicators. These data acually are US People data and they are public to do analyses. Some may believe that US census 
          data is government data and they will protect our data, but there are still questions about whether our information is safe or not. Is our privacy questionable or not? In the US 
          choropleth map, I have used the percentage of having bachelor's degrees based on gender data source (www.brookings.edu) shows that they have collected data from the Department of 
          Education. I have used the same data from the last four bar charts. The site doesn't discuss how these data were collected. Department of Education is also a government agency. It 
          looks like government agencies are using our data to publish to anlyses for the users. These things lead to the questions about our data safety or privacy, 
          how government agencies protect our data, who is contolling it, or how it is controlled.

              The above result from the visualizations shows that Masachustas has less poverty rate(10%), and the bar charts also show that Masachustas has a high number of women and
               men with bachelor's degrees. It tells that the more population have bachelor's degrees in the state, the state has a less poverty rate. Mississippi has a 20% proverty rate, 
               and the percentages of males and females obtaining bachelor's degrees are less. Since we don't know how government agencies collect demographic data and the back behind algorithms 
               from their sites, we can say from the visualizations that the Provery rate may have a negative relationship with the people of 
              Women and Male with bachelor's degrees or more.

        <p>
          The above analyses show different visualization types to show how we analyze government or other resources data without knowing its legitimacy or accuracy. 
          We don't know how the data is being collected, is the data manipulated or controlled by priveldege society or power or politics plays a role in these matters or not. 
          These visualizations of poverty rate, income, and educational attainments based on gender are just examples of questions about the privacy and safety of our data or the 
          accuracy of the data we have utilized in this project. Due to the lack of information on the lightness of the data I have used, it may be hard to conclude. Despite all 
          the obstacles, we can conclude from the above analysis from the visuals 
          that the more people having bachelor's degrees or higher education attainment, the lower the poverty rate in the USA.
